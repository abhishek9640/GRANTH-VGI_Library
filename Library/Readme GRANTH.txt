GRANTH - DIGITAL LIBRARY
INTRODUCTION
“Granth” is the digitalization of existing library system. It is aimed to automate the existing 
system of manually working processes and to manage several important activities of 
library in an online mode. It is designed to manage and track the daily work of the library 
such as issue books, return books, maintain student details, due calculation, catalogue, and 
book search etc.

OBJECTIVE
The main objective of GRANTH – VGI DIGITAL LIBRARY is to collect, record, assemble, 
retrieve, and make available the information sources to the information users. It will not 
improve data accuracy only but also optimize workflows for staff members.

PROBLEM
There is a lot time wastage in visiting library for every small work or it usually happen that 
librarian is not available. The existing system also involves too much paperwork So, we 
created online database for library to cope up with these existing problems.

REALTIME APPLICATION 
As there is no existing online library system accessible to students and faculties in VGI, we 
can use GRANTH – Digital Library Portal for managing the library of VGI.

FUTURE SCOPE 
It can be easily implemented under various situations and systems. We can add new 
features as and when we require. There is flexibility in all the modules and submodules.
